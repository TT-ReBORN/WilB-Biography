### Changed

- Image seeker
	- reinstated bar method
	- improved positioning with certain layout styles

	- removed the ability to auto-update from old versions (v1.1.3 or earlier)

### Fix
- Wine stabilisation: biography should no longer give errors in Wine, but some limitations remain:
    - paste from clipboard may not work. It can be fixed by installing [this version of Spider Monkey Panel (v1.6.2-dev+7c0928bf)](https://github.com/Wil-B/Find-and-Play/files/8575143/foo_spider_monkey_panel.zip) which includes marc2k3's utils.GetClipboardText/utils.SetClipboardText (thx to marc2k3)
    - recycler may not work. It's rarely used. If used, the console gives an alternative
    - options dialog may not load: menu now indicates there was a problem & console explains what can be done instead
- Blocked unnecessary on_size calls from Panel Stack Splitter with certain of its layout methods
- Miscellaneous fixes

### Release notes
#### Tagger
###### Last.fm
- a whitelist is now used to filter out non-genres that can be present
- statistics are now written as a multivalue tag: playcount (scrobbles), listeners & a combined score (1-100). Scores rank the long-term popularity of artists and albums on a 1-100 scale using accumulated last.fm playcount (scrobbles) and listeners

```View by score: possible view for library tree: $nodisplay{$sub(9999,$meta(Artist Statistics Last.fm,5[score]))}[$meta(Artist Statistics Last.fm,5[score]) - ]%artist%|$nodisplay{$sub(9999,$meta(Album Statistics Last.fm,5[score]))}[$meta(Album Statistics Last.fm,5[score]) - ]$if2(%album%,εXtra)|[[%discnumber%.]%tracknumber%. ][%track artist% - ]%title%```

- Additionally, Find & Play can write track statistics to tag, where that data is more relevant. See the Find & Play [changelog](https://github.com/Wil-B/Find-and-Play/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#track-popularity-tagger) for an example of a fully comprehensive popularity view

###### Wikipedia
- added option to tag genres

#### Wikipedia biographies and reviews
- Searches optionally support musicbrainz_XXXXid and MusicBrainz XXXX Id tags
- XXXX can be artist, releasegroup (release group for latter) or work
- Generally such tags shouldn't be needed. They may be useful if names differ to site names, e.g. classical works (compositions) can be variously named

<br />

# v1.2.0

	- Supports circular as well as normal images
